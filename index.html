                    <p>I will dearly miss steve jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them and
                        ever since the first one. Steve was a great man and an awesome CEO for apple. He has inspired to
                        one day and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own apple and
                        follow by Steve Jobs ways and make apple greater than before it was but i will dearly miss steve
                        jobs he is a great man and i will never forget him.</p>

                    <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
                    <p>what impact has stevejobs had on my life. every short story i have written as an adult and
                        certainly everyone that has been published. almost every email i have written have been written
                        on machines created by apple. i interacted online using an apple machine long before i ever
                        encounetered a pc. steve helped realize the star trek future i dreamed of as a kid and though
                        his vision i have been able to realize my own. you will be missed nr jobs . thanks for all your
                        amazing work</p>
